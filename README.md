# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

In this analysis we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape Mars hemisphere data from astrogeology.usgs.gov and dislay it on our own local site. We then used Bootstrap to style our site and make it mobile responsive. The Bootstrap elements that we added to the site were changing the Scrape New Data button to the Bootstrap "success" style, changed the table to the Bootstrap "striped" format, and finally we used col-md-3 to display our scraped images in a row of 4.
